## 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m **Sadiq Abdullayev**, a **Frontend Developer** from Azerbaijan 🇦🇿  
with **2+ years of professional experience** building responsive, scalable, and production-ready web applications.

I’ve worked mostly in **real business projects**, often as the **only frontend developer**, taking full ownership from design implementation to delivery. This helped me develop strong problem-solving skills and responsibility over complete features, not just isolated components.

## 💡 What I Focus On

- **Clean & Maintainable Code** – readable structure, logical flow, and refactoring when needed  
- **Real-World Problem Solving** – not just demos, but working systems  
- **UI Precision** – converting Figma designs into pixel-accurate interfaces  
- **Responsibility & Ownership** – features completed end-to-end
